# 02-Space-Shooter

created for MSCH-C220, 2/24/21

A simple space shooter with boppin' music, explosions, and three enemy ship types.

The Orange, Blue, and Green planets have formed an alliance against your home planet- the Red Planet. Take to the cosmos in your humble blaster ship and destroy as many of the attacking Orange, Blue, and Green ships as you can to defend your homeland! Watch out for deadly asteroids.
